# Traffic-Sign-Recognition

This project is a simple implemetation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize different Malaysian traffic signs, in which there are 5 classes: 
#### No-entry, One-way, Parking, Speed-bump & Stop.


Attached in this repository are as follows:

- TrafficSignRecognition.ipynb (A notebook file with source code)
- tsr_wts.pth (The weights for 100% accuracy in testing)
- Traffic Sign Dataset (download link for the dataset I used)
